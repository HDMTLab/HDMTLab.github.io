### About us
Our HDMPLab is working on high dimensional data, hypothesis testing, classification, statistical inference.

### Research


#### Multiple Testing 
Multiple testing procedures are playing a key role in high dimensional problem such as variable selection and dimension reduction and 
genetics such as GWAS and protein data.
