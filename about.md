### About us
Our HDMPLab is working on high dimensional data, hypothesis testing, classification, statistical inference.

## Research

HDMTLab covers the following research areas. 


### Multiple Testing 
_Multiple testing procedures are playing a key role in high dimensional problem such as variable selection and dimension reduction and 
genetics such as GWAS and protein domain data.  One major issue in multiple testing problem is to identifying the null distribution empirically.  We develop methods to estimate the null distribution based on mixture of well known distributions or empirical likelihood.  method.  Our current project includes some recent development of multiple testing procedures such as [knockoff](https://web.stanford.edu/group/candes/knockoffs/), mirror statistics and data splitting._

### Hypothesis Testing 
_Some classical idea of ombinus or global testing methods have been extended to high dimension dramatically for the last two decades. One typical problem is the extension of Hotelling's T test for testing equality of mean vector to high dimensional case. Our research in testing in high dimension includes  hihg dimensional Behrens-Fisher problem and simultaneous test of mean  vectors and covariance matrces. <br>
In meta analysis, testing the homogeneity of effect sizes or distributions from many different studies is important before we decide to combine all studies or consider random effect model to explain the variations among different studies.  Our research includes a variety of hypothesis testing problems such as high dimensional testing or some classifical testing problems in meta analysis._
