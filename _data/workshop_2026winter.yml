  title: "Random Direction Tests for a Multivariate Normal Mean under Polyhedral Cone Constraints"
  speaker: "고준혁 (서울대)"
  abstract: >
    We study hypothesis testing for a multivariate normal mean subject to linear inequality constraints, where the parameter space is a polyhedral cone. Classical procedures for one-sided multivariate testing—most notably the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and O’Brien’s test~\cite{Tang}—are well understood when the cone is the nonnegative orthant, but their behavior can be unstable for general cones and under unknown covariance. Building on an ensemble idea~\cite{Ensemble}, we propose four new tests—the Single Direction Test (SDT), the Ensemble Direction Test (EDT), the Hartung Direction Test (HDT), and the Maximum Direction Test (MDT)—that aggregate $p$-values using randomly generated directions in the cone. Across a wide range of alternatives and covariance structures, our simulations show that the EDT attains higher power than the GLRT, which is often conservative in the unknown-covariance setting. On the other hand, the EDT can exhibit inflated type~I error at moderate significance levels and can be computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings.

  title: "Two-Sample Projection Test for High-Dimensional Functional Data"
  speaker: "김현성 (서울대)"
  abstract: >
    We propose a novel two-sample test for high-dimensional functional data, termed the Data-Splitting Projection Test for High-dimensional Functional Data (DSPT-HFD). In settings where the number of functional covariates $p$ far exceeds the sample size $n$, existing methods often face computational challenges or lack theoretical guarantees. The proposed method utilizes a data-splitting strategy to estimate an optimal projection direction that maximizes group mean differences using one data subset, and performs a two-sample test on the projected univariate samples using the remaining subset. The optimal projection direction is estimated by solving a penalized least squares problem with a group non-convex penalty. We theoretically establish the consistency of the estimated direction and prove that the asymptotic power of the test converges to one. Extensive simulation studies and applications to ADHD-200 and EEG datasets demonstrate that DSPT-HFD achieves superior power compared to existing methods while robustly controlling type-I error rates, even under violations of standard assumptions.

  title: "Shrinkage-Clustered Conformal Prediction"
  speaker: "김지수 (서울대)"
  abstract: >
    Standard conformal prediction provides valid marginal coverage but often fails to ensure fairness or conditional reliability across classes. Class-conditional conformal prediction (CC-CP) mitigates this issue by calibrating within each class or class cluster. Although its performance deteriorates when calibration data are limited for minority classes, leading to unstable or excessively large prediction sets. We propose Shrinkage Class-Clustered Conformal Prediction (SCC—CP), a distribution free method that constructs conformal prediction sets by adaptively shrinking cluster-level conformal quantile toward a global conformal quantile using data-driven weights.
